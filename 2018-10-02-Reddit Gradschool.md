The internet can be a pretty [toxic, nasty place](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xxymb/here-are-reddits-whiniest-most-low-key-toxic-subreddit) (*Warning: NSFW language), especially when like-minded toxic, nasty people get together to share their toxic, nasty thoughts. Of course, seeking out virtual interaction with like-minded people is [sometimes good](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/these-are-the-online-communities-we-will-never-forget/). And sometimes the much-maligned "front page of the internet" can [be good and do good](https://gizmodo.com/reddit-is-helping-some-people-deal-with-their-mental-he-1825364592).

These were some of the thoughts I had as I was planning out my fourth project at Metis, which emphasized Natural Language Processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning. Going through the vast data and resources from the [Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP)](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html), I was drawn to [a study](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-RedditPizzaRequests.html) about [requests for free pizza](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-RedditPizzaRequests.html) made on [r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/).
