title: The two-man game

Previously, I [wrote](https://douglaswlee.github.io/NBA-Performance/) a little about a preliminary study to understand what contributes to underperformance and overperformance by NBA teams in terms of the difference between their expected (Pythagorean) winning percentage and their actual winning percentage. One thing that I believed severely limited my efforts (among others) was the absence of lineup-level data (see below) to potentially characterize potential inefficiencies in allocation of minutes on the court between different players.
